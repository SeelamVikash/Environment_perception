1.Use the output of semantic segmentation neural networks to implement drivable space estimation in 3D.<br>
2.Use the output of semantic segmentation neural networks to implement lane estimation.<br>
3.Use the output of semantic segmentation to filter errors in the output of 2D object detectors.<br>
4.Use the filtered 2D object detection results to determine how far obstacles are from the self-driving car.<br>

â€¢ To look how everything has been implemented, please refer to the Project folder.
