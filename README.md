This is done using the self driving cars specialization in Coursera and in this assignment, you will learn:

- Use the output of semantic segmentation neural networks to implement drivable space estimation in 3D.
- Use the output of semantic segmentation neural networks to implement lane estimation.
- Use the output of semantic segmentation to filter errors in the output of 2D object detectors.
- Use the filtered 2D object detection results to determine how far obstacles are from the self-driving car.

keep motivated and keep learning. All the best :D XD
